    <s>I want to tell you something</s>
    <s>I was scared of English</s>
    <s>Really scared</s>
    <s>Words and grammar were hard for me</s>
    <s>I opened grammar books and felt confused</s>
    <s>Sometimes I wanted to stop</s>
    <s>I thought, “Maybe I can't learn English”</s>
    <s>Or, “Maybe English is not for me”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But one small thing changed my mind</s>
    <s>That day, I stopped being afraid of grammar</s>
    <s>I started to like it</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Now I want to tell you what helped me</s>
    <s>Maybe it will help you too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Come with me on this journey</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>In school, my teacher said</s>
    <s>"Learn grammar. Learn the rules"</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But the rules were very hard</s>
    <s>So many names</s>
    <s>I learned them for a test</s>
    <s>Then I forgot them</s>
    <s>I felt sad</s>
    <s>I thought I was not smart</s>
    <s>Sometimes I didn’t want to try</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But deep inside, I wanted to speak English</s>
    <s>I just needed a better way</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, I went to the library</s>
    <s>I wanted a fun book</s>
    <s>I saw a man reading a grammar book</s>
    <s>He looked happy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I asked him, “Do you like grammar”</s>
    <s>He said, “Yes. I play with it”</s>
    <s>I said, “Play”</s>
    <s>He said, “I use stories and fun ideas</s>
    <s>I don’t just read the rules”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I felt hope</s>
    <s>I went home and opened my grammar book</s>
    <s>Then I closed it and smiled</s>
    <s>I took a notebook</s>
    <s>I wrote, “Day One – Present Simple”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I did not read a lot</s>
    <s>I wrote five easy sentences</s>
    <s>I wake up</s>
    <s>I brush my teeth</s>
    <s>I eat breakfast</s>
    <s>I go to work</s>
    <s>I sleep at ten</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>The next day, I used the past tense</s>
    <s>I woke up</s>
    <s>I brushed my teeth</s>
    <s>I ate breakfast</s>
    <s>I went to work</s>
    <s>I slept at ten</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar started to make sense</s>
    <s>I was using my own life</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I talked to myself in English</s>
    <s>Yes, it was funny</s>
    <s>But it helped</s>
    <s>I asked, “What did I do today”</s>
    <s>I said, “I went to the store</s>
    <s>I bought apples</s>
    <s>I made lunch</s>
    <s>I watched a show”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I watched videos with subtitles</s>
    <s>I stopped the video</s>
    <s>I said the words again</s>
    <s>I copied the way they spoke</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I also wrote little stories</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>“Yesterday, I visited my grandma</s>
    <s>She gave me cake</s>
    <s>We drank tea</s>
    <s>We talked”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I made many mistakes</s>
    <s>But I didn’t feel bad</s>
    <s>Each mistake helped me learn</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t study for ten hours</s>
    <s>I didn’t go to big schools</s>
    <s>I just learned one small thing every day</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One idea</s>
    <s>One example</s>
    <s>One sentence</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>After three months, I felt better</s>
    <s>After six months, I spoke better</s>
    <s>After one year, grammar was easy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Then I learned about parts of speech</s>
    <s>These are small grammar blocks</s>
    <s>There are eight</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Nouns – people or things: girl, dog</s>
    <s>Pronouns – like I, he, they</s>
    <s>Verbs – actions: run, eat</s>
    <s>Adjectives – words like big, red</s>
    <s>Adverbs – like slowly, well</s>
    <s>Prepositions – in, on, at</s>
    <s>Conjunctions – and, but</s>
    <s>Interjections – wow, oh</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t try to learn all at once</s>
    <s>I made fun sentences</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>"Wow</s>
    <s>The big dog ran on the bed and barked loudly"</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>It was fun</s>
    <s>Grammar was like a game</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>So listen</s>
    <s>You don’t need to be perfect</s>
    <s>You just need to keep going</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar is not only for school</s>
    <s>It helps you talk about life</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use present</s>
    <s>I eat rice</s>
    <s>I go to school</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use past</s>
    <s>I ate rice</s>
    <s>I went to school</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use future</s>
    <s>I will eat rice</s>
    <s>I will go to school</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That’s it</s>
    <s>You are learning</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Make grammar fun</s>
    <s>Don’t be scared</s>
    <s>Even mistakes can help you</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>If someone says, “Grammar is boring”</s>
    <s>I smile</s>
    <s>Because grammar helps me speak</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I was scared</s>
    <s>Now I feel strong</s>
    <s>If I can do it</s>
    <s>You can too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Take one step today</s>
    <s>Take one more tomorrow</s>
    <s>Keep going</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Your English will grow</s>
    <s>Grammar will become easy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, someone will ask</s>
    <s>“How did you learn grammar”</s>
    <s>You will say</s>
    <s>“Let me tell you a story”</s>
  </p>
