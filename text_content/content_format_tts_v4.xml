    <s>I want to share something with you</s>
    <s>I used to feel nervous about English</s>
    <s>Really nervous</s>
    <s>Words, grammar, even simple sentences <emphasis>–</emphasis> they confused me</s>
    <s>I opened grammar books and felt lost</s>
    <s>Sometimes I wanted to give up</s>
    <s>I thought, “Maybe English is too hard for me”</s>
    <s>Or, “Maybe I’m not good at languages”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But then something small changed everything</s>
    <s>From that day, I stopped fighting with grammar</s>
    <s>And I started to understand it</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Now, I want to tell you how that happened</s>
    <s>Because if it helped me</s>
    <s>It might help you too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Let’s go on this new journey together</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Back in school, my teacher always said</s>
    <s>"Study grammar. Learn the rules"</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But those rules felt too difficult</s>
    <s>Future perfect, present continuous <emphasis>…</emphasis> so many names</s>
    <s>I memorized the rules for tests</s>
    <s>And then I forgot them the next day</s>
    <s>I felt disappointed</s>
    <s>I felt like I couldn’t do it</s>
    <s>Sometimes I didn’t want to try</s>
    <s>I believed grammar was only for clever students</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But deep down, I still had a dream</s>
    <s>I wanted to speak English clearly</s>
    <s>I just needed a new way to learn</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One afternoon, I walked into the library</s>
    <s>I wanted a comic book</s>
    <s>But then I saw a man reading a grammar book</s>
    <s>He looked happy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I asked, “Do you enjoy grammar”</s>
    <s>He said, “Yes. I play with it”</s>
    <s>"Play" I asked</s>
    <s>He smiled</s>
    <s>“I use stories. I try fun ideas. I don’t only study rules”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That was the moment I felt something</s>
    <s>I went home and smiled at my grammar book</s>
    <s>I picked up a notebook and wrote</s>
    <s>"Day One – Present Simple"</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t read too much</s>
    <s>I wrote 5 easy sentences</s>
    <s>I wake up</s>
    <s>I brush my teeth</s>
    <s>I eat breakfast</s>
    <s>I go to work</s>
    <s>I sleep at 10</s>
    <s>That was all</s>
    <s>It felt good</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>The next day, I tried the past tense</s>
    <s>I woke up</s>
    <s>I brushed my teeth</s>
    <s>I ate breakfast</s>
    <s>I went to work</s>
    <s>I slept at 10</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Suddenly, grammar made sense</s>
    <s>I was using my real life</s>
    <s>My own words</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I started talking to myself in English</s>
    <s>It sounds funny, but it helped</s>
    <s>I asked, “What did I do today”</s>
    <s>And I answered out loud</s>
    <s>I went shopping</s>
    <s>I bought fruit</s>
    <s>I cooked lunch</s>
    <s>I watched a movie</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I watched English videos with subtitles</s>
    <s>I paused the video</s>
    <s>I repeated the sentences</s>
    <s>I copied the way they spoke</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I also wrote small stories</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>"Yesterday, I visited my aunt</s>
    <s>She gave me cookies</s>
    <s>We drank tea and talked"</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I made many mistakes</s>
    <s>But I smiled</s>
    <s>Each mistake helped me learn</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t study for 10 hours</s>
    <s>I didn’t pay for big classes</s>
    <s>I made one small promise</s>
    <s>Learn one small thing every day</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One point</s>
    <s>One example</s>
    <s>One sentence</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>After 3 months, I felt better</s>
    <s>After 6 months, I spoke better</s>
    <s>After 1 year, grammar was easy</s>
    <s>It felt like a friend</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Then I learned something fun</s>
    <s>Grammar has 8 parts</s>
    <s>They are like small pieces of a puzzle</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Nouns – people and things: teacher, book, dog</s>
    <s>Pronouns – like he, she, we</s>
    <s>Verbs – actions: run, sleep, eat</s>
    <s>Adjectives – describe: big, happy, red</s>
    <s>Adverbs – how we do something: slowly, well</s>
    <s>Prepositions – show place or time: in, at, on</s>
    <s>Conjunctions – join words: and, but, or</s>
    <s>Interjections – show feelings: wow, hey, oh no</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t try to remember them all</s>
    <s>I played with them in silly sentences</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>“Hey</s>
    <s>The blue cat danced on the table and sang loudly”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That sentence had almost all parts of grammar</s>
    <s>It made me laugh</s>
    <s>Grammar became a game</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>So let me tell you this</s>
    <s>You don’t have to be perfect</s>
    <s>You just have to stay curious</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar is not only for tests</s>
    <s>It helps you say what you feel</s>
    <s>Talk about your life</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use present tense</s>
    <s>I eat lunch</s>
    <s>I read a book</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use past tense</s>
    <s>I ate lunch</s>
    <s>I read a book yesterday</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use future tense</s>
    <s>I will eat lunch</s>
    <s>I will read tomorrow</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That’s it</s>
    <s>It’s simple</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Make grammar fun</s>
    <s>Make it your friend</s>
    <s>Don’t be scared</s>
    <s>Mistakes are part of learning</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>When someone says grammar is boring</s>
    <s>I smile</s>
    <s>Because I know grammar gives me power</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I was scared</s>
    <s>Now I feel strong</s>
    <s>If I can do it</s>
    <s>You can too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Just take one small step today</s>
    <s>Then one more tomorrow</s>
    <s>Keep walking</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Your English will grow</s>
    <s>Your grammar will become easy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, someone will ask you</s>
    <s>“How did you learn grammar”</s>
    <s>And you’ll say</s>
    <s>“Let me tell you a story”</s>
  </p>
