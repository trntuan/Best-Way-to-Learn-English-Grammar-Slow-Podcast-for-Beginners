    <s>Hello, my friend</s>
    <s>I want to share a story</s>
    <s>It’s about learning English</s>
    <s>I was very scared</s>
    <s>English felt so hard</s>
    <s>Words were strange</s>
    <s>Grammar was worse</s>
    <s>I opened a book</s>
    <s>I saw many rules</s>
    <s>I felt confused</s>
    <s>I wanted to stop</s>
    <s>I thought, “English is not for me”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But something changed</s>
    <s>I found a new way</s>
    <s>It was simple</s>
    <s>It was fun</s>
    <s>Now I love English</s>
    <s>Grammar is easy for me</s>
    <s>I want to help you</s>
    <s>Maybe my story helps you</s>
    <s>Let’s go on this journey</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>In school, I had a teacher</s>
    <s>She said, “Learn grammar rules”</s>
    <s>But rules were so hard</s>
    <s>I saw many words</s>
    <s>Like “present simple”</s>
    <s>Or “past tense”</s>
    <s>I learned for tests</s>
    <s>Then I forgot everything</s>
    <s>I felt sad</s>
    <s>I thought I was not smart</s>
    <s>Sometimes I didn’t try</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But I wanted to speak English</s>
    <s>I wanted to talk to people</s>
    <s>I wanted to watch movies</s>
    <s>I wanted to understand songs</s>
    <s>I needed a better way</s>
    <s>I needed something fun</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, I went to a park</s>
    <s>I saw a girl reading</s>
    <s>She had a grammar book</s>
    <s>She looked happy</s>
    <s>I was surprised</s>
    <s>I asked, “Do you like grammar?”</s>
    <s>She smiled</s>
    <s>She said, “Yes, it’s fun”</s>
    <s>I said, “Fun?”</s>
    <s>She said, “I make stories”</s>
    <s>“I use my life”</s>
    <s>“I don’t just read rules”</s>

    <s>I felt <emphasis>hope</emphasis></s>
    <s>I went home</s>
    <s>I took a notebook</s>
    <s>I wrote, “Day One – Present Simple”</s>
    <s>I didn’t read a lot</s>
    <s>I wrote five sentences</s>
    <s>I wake up at seven</s>
    <s>I drink coffee</s>
    <s>I go to school</s>
    <s>I eat lunch at noon</s>
    <s>I sleep at ten</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>These sentences were about me</s>
    <s>They were easy</s>
    <s>I said them out loud</s>
    <s>I felt happy</s>
    <s>Grammar was not scary</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>The next day, I tried past tense</s>
    <s>I wrote five more sentences</s>
    <s>Yesterday, I woke up at seven</s>
    <s>I drank coffee</s>
    <s>I went to school</s>
    <s>I ate lunch at noon</s>
    <s>I slept at ten</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar started to make sense</s>
    <s>I used my own life</s>
    <s>It was like a game</s>
    <s>I talked to myself in English</s>
    <s>Yes, it was funny</s>
    <s>I said, “What did I do today?”</s>
    <s>I answered, “I went to the market”</s>
    <s>“I bought fruit”</s>
    <s>“I ate an apple”</s>
    <s>“I watched TV”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I watched cartoons in English</s>
    <s>I turned on subtitles</s>
    <s>I stopped the video</s>
    <s>I repeated the words</s>
    <s>I copied how they spoke</s>
    <s>It helped me a lot</s>

  <p>
    <s>I also wrote short stories</s>

    <s>“Yesterday, I visited my friend”</s>
    <s>“We played games”</s>
    <s>“We ate pizza”</s>
    <s>“We laughed a lot”</s>
    <s>These stories were simple</s>

<speak>
  <p>
    <s>I made mistakes</s>
    <s>I said, “I goed to school”</s>
    <s>It was wrong</s>
    <s>The right word is “went”</s>
    <s>But I didn’t feel bad</s>
    <s>Each mistake helped me learn</s>
    <s>I wrote the right sentence</s>
    <s>I said, “I went to school”</s>
    <s>I smiled</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t study all day</s>
    <s>I learned one thing each day</s>
    <s>One sentence</s>
    <s>One idea</s>
    <s>One example</s>
    <s>It was enough</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>After one month, I felt better</s>
    <s>After three months, I spoke more</s>
    <s>After six months, grammar was easier</s>
    <s>I was proud</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Let me tell you about grammar</s>
    <s>Grammar is like building blocks</s>
    <s>Each block has a name</s>
    <s>There are eight blocks</s>
    <s>They are called parts of speech</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>First, nouns</s>
    <s>Nouns are people or things</s>
    <s>Like “cat”</s>
    <s>Or “teacher”</s>
    <s>Or “table”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “The cat sleeps”</s>
    <s>“Cat” is a noun</s>
  </p>
</speak>  
<!-- doan 4 -->
<speak>
  <p>
    <s>Second, pronouns</s>
    <s>Pronouns are small words</s>
    <s>Like “I”</s>
    <s>Or “he”</s>
    <s>Or “they”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “He runs”</s>
    <s>“He” is a pronoun</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Third, verbs</s>
    <s>Verbs are actions</s>
    <s>Like “run”</s>
    <s>Or “eat”</s>
    <s>Or “sleep”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “I eat rice”</s>
    <s>“Eat” is a verb</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Fourth, adjectives</s>
    <s>Adjectives describe things</s>
    <s>Like “big”</s>
    <s>Or “red”</s>
    <s>Or “happy”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “The big dog jumps”</s>
    <s>“Big” is an adjective</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Fifth, adverbs</s>
    <s>Adverbs describe actions</s>
    <s>Like “quickly”</s>
    <s>Or “well”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “She sings well”</s>
    <s>“Well” is an adverb</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Sixth, prepositions</s>
    <s>Prepositions show place or time</s>
    <s>Like “in”</s>
    <s>Or “on”</s>
    <s>Or “at”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “I sit on the chair”</s>
    <s>“On” is a preposition</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Seventh, conjunctions</s>
    <s>Conjunctions connect ideas</s>
    <s>Like “and”</s>
    <s>Or “but”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “I eat and drink”</s>
    <s>“And” is a conjunction</s>
  </p>
</speak>  
<!-- doan 5 -->
<speak>
  <p>
    <s>Eighth, interjections</s>
    <s>Interjections show feelings</s>
    <s>Like “wow”</s>
    <s>Or “oh”</s>
    <s>I wrote, “Wow, it’s fun”</s>
    <s>“Wow” is an interjection</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t learn all blocks at once</s>
    <s>I learned one each week</s>
    <s>I made fun sentences</s>
    <s>Like this</s>
    <s>“Wow, the small cat runs quickly”</s>
    <s>It has an interjection</s>
    <s>An adjective</s>
    <s>A noun</s>
    <s>A verb</s>
    <s>An adverb</s>
    <s>It was so fun</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar became a game</s>
    <s>I played with words</s>
    <s>I wrote about my day</s>
    <s>I wrote about my family</s>
    <s>I wrote about my dreams</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Let me teach you one trick</s>
    <s>Use grammar in your life</s>
    <s>Talk about your morning</s>
    <s>Use present tense</s>
    <s>I wake up early</s>
    <s>I brush my teeth</s>
    <s>I eat bread</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Now talk about yesterday</s>
    <s>Use past tense</s>
    <s>I woke up early</s>
    <s>I brushed my teeth</s>
    <s>I ate bread</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Now talk about tomorrow</s>
    <s>Use future tense</s>
    <s>I will wake up early</s>
    <s>I will brush my teeth</s>
    <s>I will eat bread</s>
  </p>

    <s>You are using grammar</s>
    <s>You are learning</s>

<speak>
  <p>
    <s>Another trick is singing</s>
    <s>Find a simple English song</s>
    <s>Like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”</s>
    <s>Sing it every day</s>
    <s>Listen to the words</s>
    <s>They use grammar</s>
    <s>You learn without thinking</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I also used my phone</s>
    <s>I recorded myself</s>
    <s>I said, “Hello, I am happy”</s>
    <s>I listened to my voice</s>
    <s>I laughed</s>
    <s>But I got better</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I talked to my friends</s>
    <s>I said, “I like your shirt”</s>
    <s>They smiled</s>
    <s>They said, “Thank you”</s>
    <s>We used simple English</s>
    <s>It was fun</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Sometimes I felt tired</s>
    <s>Learning was slow</s>
    <s>But I didn’t stop</s>
    <s>I remembered my goal</s>
    <s>I wanted to speak English</s>
    <s>I wanted to feel strong</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, I watched a movie</s>
    <s>It was in English</s>
    <s>I understood many words</s>
    <s>I felt so happy</s>
    <s>I said, “I can do this”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Now, grammar is my friend</s>
    <s>It helps me talk</s>
    <s>It helps me write</s>
    <s>It helps me understand</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>So, listen to me</s>
    <s>You don’t need to be perfect</s>
    <s>You don’t need big books</s>
    <s>You need small steps</s>
    <s>Write one sentence today</s>
    <s>Say one sentence tomorrow</s>
    <s>Keep going</s>

  <p>
    <s>Mistakes are okay</s>
    <s>They help you grow</s>
    <s>Every mistake is a lesson</s>
    <s>Every sentence is a win</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>If someone says, “Grammar is boring”</s>
    <s>Smile and say, “It’s fun”</s>
    <s>Tell them about your sentences</s>
    <s>Tell them about your stories</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I was scared of English</s>
    <s>Now I feel strong</s>
    <s>I learned step by step</s>
    <s>You can learn too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Start today</s>
    <s>Write about your breakfast</s>
    <s>Say, “I eat eggs”</s>
    <s>Tomorrow, say, “I ate eggs”</s>
    <s>Next day, say, “I will eat eggs”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Your English will grow</s>
    <s>Your fear will go away</s>
