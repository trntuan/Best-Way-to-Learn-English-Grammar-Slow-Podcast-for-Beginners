    <s>I want to tell you a secret</s>
    <s>I was scared of English grammar</s>
    <s>Yes, very scared</s>
    <s>Tenses, prepositions, articles <emphasis>–</emphasis> I didn’t understand them</s>
    <s>I looked at grammar books and felt sleepy</s>
    <s>Sometimes I felt stupid</s>
    <s>I thought, “Maybe I cannot learn English”</s>
    <s>I even thought, “Maybe English is not for me”</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But one day, something small changed everything</s>
    <s>From that day, grammar was not my enemy</s>
    <s>Grammar became my friend</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Today, I will tell you my story</s>
    <s>And remember</s>
    <s>If I can do it, you can do it too</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Let’s go together on this journey</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I remember my school days</s>
    <s>My English teacher always said</s>
    <s>“Learn the rules. Learn the grammar”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But grammar rules were very hard</s>
    <s>Past perfect, future continuous <emphasis>…</emphasis> so many names</s>
    <s>I tried to remember everything for the test</s>
    <s>But the next day, I forgot</s>
    <s>I felt bad</s>
    <s>I felt like I failed</s>
    <s>Sometimes I didn’t even try</s>
    <s>I thought grammar was only for smart people</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>But deep inside, I still wanted to learn</s>
    <s>I wanted to speak English</s>
    <s>I just didn’t know how</s>

  <p>
    <s>One day, something happened</s>
    <s>I went to the library</s>
    <s>I wanted a story book</s>
    <s>But I saw a man</s>
    <s>He was reading a grammar book</s>
    <s>And he was smiling</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I asked him, “Do you like grammar”</s>
    <s>He said, “Yes. I play with grammar”</s>
    <s>“Play” I asked</s>
    <s>“Yes” he said</s>
    <s>“I use stories, I use fun examples. I don’t just study the rules”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>This gave me hope</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That night, I went home</s>
    <s>I opened my grammar books</s>
    <s>Then I closed them</s>
    <s>I smiled</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I took a notebook</s>
    <s>I wrote: “Day One – Present Simple Tense”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t study 10 pages</s>
    <s>I wrote 5 simple sentences</s>
    <s>I wake up</s>
    <s>I brush my teeth</s>
    <s>I eat breakfast</s>
    <s>I go to work</s>
    <s>I sleep at 10 p.m</s>
    <s>That’s it</s>
    <s>It felt easy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Next day: Day Two – Past Simple</s>
    <s>I woke up</s>
    <s>I brushed my teeth</s>
    <s>I ate breakfast</s>
    <s>I went to work</s>
    <s>I slept at 10 p.m</s>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar started to make sense</s>
    <s>It was my life</s>
    <s>My words</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I started talking to myself in English</s>
    <s>Yes, it sounds funny</s>
    <s>But it helped me</s>
    <s>I said, “What did I do today”</s>
    <s>I answered</s>
    <s>I went to the market</s>
    <s>I bought apples</s>
    <s>I cooked lunch</s>
    <s>I watched cartoons</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I used subtitles</s>
    <s>I paused the video</s>
    <s>I repeated the sentences</s>
    <s>I copied the way they spoke</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I wrote small stories</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>“Yesterday, I visited my grandma</s>
    <s>She gave me sweets</s>
    <s>We drank tea</s>
    <s>We talked about old times”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>And when I made mistakes, I smiled</s>
    <s>Because mistakes helped me</s>
    <s>Each mistake was a small teacher</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t study 10 hours</s>
    <s>I didn’t go to expensive classes</s>
    <s>I just made one small rule</s>
    <s>Learn one small thing every day</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One grammar point</s>
    <s>One example</s>
    <s>One new sentence</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>After 3 months, grammar was easier</s>
    <s>After 6 months, I could speak better</s>
    <s>After 1 year, grammar was simple</s>
    <s>It became my friend</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Then I learned about “parts of speech”</s>
    <s>These are the building blocks of grammar</s>
    <s>There are 8 parts</s>
    <s>Let me tell you</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Nouns – names: teacher, book, city</s>
    <s>Pronouns – he, she, they</s>
    <s>Verbs – action: eat, go, sleep</s>
    <s>Adjectives – describe nouns: red apple, tall man</s>
    <s>Adverbs – describe verbs: walk slowly</s>
    <s>Prepositions – show place or time: in, on, at</s>
    <s>Conjunctions – join words: and, but, because</s>
    <s>Interjections – show feelings: wow, oh no, hooray</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>I didn’t try to remember all of them</s>
    <s>I used them in funny sentences</s>
    <s>Like</s>
    <s>“Wow</s>
    <s>The red dog jumped on the table and barked loudly”</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That one sentence had 7 parts of speech</s>
    <s>It was fun</s>
    <s>Grammar became a game</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>So my friend, listen to me</s>
    <s>You don’t need to be perfect</s>
    <s>You only need to be curious</s>

  <p>
    <s>Grammar is not just for tests</s>
    <s>It helps you speak</s>
    <s>Talk about your life</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use present tense</s>
    <s>I eat rice</s>
    <s>I go to work</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use past tense</s>
    <s>I ate rice</s>
    <s>I went to work</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Use future tense</s>
    <s>I will eat rice</s>
    <s>I will go to work</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>That’s it</s>
    <s>You are learning</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Make grammar fun</s>
    <s>Make grammar your friend</s>
    <s>Don’t be afraid</s>
    <s>Even 100 mistakes can help you</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>So now, when someone says, “Grammar is boring”</s>
    <s>I smile</s>
    <s>Because I know <emphasis>–</emphasis> grammar is not my enemy</s>
    <s>It is my superpower</s>

  <p>
    <s>Take one small step today</s>
    <s>Then another tomorrow</s>
    <s>And one more the next day</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>Keep going</s>
    <s>Don’t stop</s>
    <s>Your English will grow</s>
    <s>Your grammar will become easy</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>One day, someone will ask you</s>
    <s>“How did you learn grammar”</s>
    <s>And you will say</s>
    <s>“Let me tell you a story”</s>
