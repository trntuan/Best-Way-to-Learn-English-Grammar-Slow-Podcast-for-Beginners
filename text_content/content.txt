🎧 Title: Grammar Used To Scare Me – Easy English Listening | A1

[00:00:00]I want to tell you a secret.I was scared of English grammar.Yes, very scared.Tenses, prepositions, articles – I didn’t understand them.I looked at grammar books and felt sleepy.Sometimes I felt stupid.I thought, “Maybe I cannot learn English.”I even thought, “Maybe English is not for me.”

But one day, something small changed everything.From that day, grammar was not my enemy.Grammar became my friend.

Today, I will tell you my story.And remember: If I can do it, you can do it too.

[00:00:46]Let’s go together on this journey.

I remember my school days.My English teacher always said,“Learn the rules. Learn the grammar.”

But grammar rules were very hard.Past perfect, future continuous… so many names!I tried to remember everything for the test.But the next day, I forgot.I felt bad.I felt like I failed.Sometimes I didn’t even try.I thought grammar was only for smart people.

But deep inside, I still wanted to learn.I wanted to speak English.I just didn’t know how.

[00:01:35]One day, something happened.I went to the library.I wanted a story book.But I saw a man.He was reading a grammar book.And he was smiling!

I asked him, “Do you like grammar?”He said, “Yes. I play with grammar.”“Play?” I asked.“Yes,” he said.“I use stories, I use fun examples. I don’t just study the rules.”

This gave me hope.

[00:02:10]That night, I went home.I opened my grammar books.Then I closed them.I smiled.

I took a notebook.I wrote: “Day One – Present Simple Tense.”

I didn’t study 10 pages.I wrote 5 simple sentences:I wake up.I brush my teeth.I eat breakfast.I go to work.I sleep at 10 p.m.

That’s it. It felt easy.

[00:02:49]Next day: Day Two – Past Simple.I woke up.I brushed my teeth.I ate breakfast.I went to work.I slept at 10 p.m.

Grammar started to make sense.It was my life. My words.

I started talking to myself in English.Yes, it sounds funny.But it helped me.I said, “What did I do today?”I answered:I went to the market.I bought apples.I cooked lunch.I watched cartoons.

[00:03:29]I used subtitles.I paused the video.I repeated the sentences.I copied the way they spoke.

I wrote small stories.Like:“Yesterday, I visited my grandma.She gave me sweets.We drank tea.We talked about old times.”

And when I made mistakes, I smiled.Because mistakes helped me.Each mistake was a small teacher.

[00:04:03]I didn’t study 10 hours.I didn’t go to expensive classes.I just made one small rule:Learn one small thing every day.

One grammar point.One example.One new sentence.

After 3 months, grammar was easier.After 6 months, I could speak better.After 1 year, grammar was simple.It became my friend.

[00:04:49]Then I learned about “parts of speech.”These are the building blocks of grammar.There are 8 parts. Let me tell you:

Nouns – names: teacher, book, city.

Pronouns – he, she, they.

Verbs – action: eat, go, sleep.

Adjectives – describe nouns: red apple, tall man.

Adverbs – describe verbs: walk slowly.

Prepositions – show place or time: in, on, at.

Conjunctions – join words: and, but, because.

Interjections – show feelings: wow, oh no, hooray!

[00:05:36]I didn’t try to remember all of them.I used them in funny sentences.

Like:“Wow! The red dog jumped on the table and barked loudly.”

That one sentence had 7 parts of speech!It was fun.Grammar became a game.

[00:06:00]So my friend, listen to me.You don’t need to be perfect.You only need to be curious.

Grammar is not just for tests.It helps you speak.Talk about your life.

Use present tense:I eat rice. I go to work.

Use past tense:I ate rice. I went to work.

Use future tense:I will eat rice. I will go to work.

That’s it. You are learning.

[00:06:48]Make grammar fun.Make grammar your friend.Don’t be afraid.Even 100 mistakes can help you.

So now, when someone says, “Grammar is boring,”I smile.Because I know – grammar is not my enemy.It is my superpower.

And if I, a shy and scared student, can learn…then you can too.Yes, you.

Take one small step today.Then another tomorrow.And one more the next day.

Keep going.Don’t stop.Your English will grow.Your grammar will become easy.

One day, someone will ask you:“How did you learn grammar?”And you will say,“Let me tell you a story.”
